# TextCraft

This is a very simple, text based adventure game engine. It was designed
to teach Python programming, and some simple game programming concepts.

## Running TextCraft

To run TextCraft, you need to download and install python. Then go to your
terminal and type:

    python textcraft.py

There are a number of resources to help you properly install [python on
Windows](http://docs.python.org/2/using/windows.html). Google around, and
ask on forums if you need help.

## Then what?

Then start hacking!
